company_bio: "We came across each other during our master’s course in Devising Theatre
  and Performance at **LISPA Berlin**, in collaboration with **Rose Bruford College
  London**. We are a group of interdisciplinary artists who collaborate without the
  reliance on particular hierarchies.   \n  \nWe create devised performances using
  a minimal aesthetic, and an artistic language that is malleable and accommodating
  to our visiting collaborators.   \n  \nWe want to provoke a theatrical experience
  that explores how the creation of work can inform, influence, and be affected by
  the social environment. By using long periods of research and rehearsal, we create
  theatre that alludes to the rebuilding of a sense of **community** in contemporary
  society.   \n  \nOur first collaborator was a fish from LIDL."

  name: Matteo Carpi
  bio: He trained at the “Royal Central School of Speech and Drama”. He also studied
    music and trained in Linklater’s Voice method “Freeing the Natural Voice”. He’s
    been working as musician, per- former, videomaker and web-developer. In his spare
    time, he makes cheese porn, which is particularly tasteless, making him a respectable
    member of the community.

  bio: Previously graduated in Acting and Dramatic Art at the ESAD Asturias, has been
    working as a performer and director in Spain, Portugal and Germany. She says she’s
    always cold, but we actually think she just loves the feeling of being hugged,
    all the time, by clothes.

    as a Theatre Maker at the University of Kent. After working as an actor for theatre
    and film in England and touring internationally, he then relocated to Berlin where

    Karaoke nights.
