company_bio: "We came across each other during our master’s course in Devising Theatre
  and Performance at **LISPA Berlin**, in collaboration with **Rose Bruford College
  London**. We are a group of interdisciplinary artists who collaborate without the
  reliance on particular hierarchies.   \n  \nWe create devised performances using
  a minimal aesthetic, and an artistic language that is malleable and accommodating
  to our visiting collaborators.   \n  \nWe want to provoke a theatrical experience
  that explores how the creation of work can inform, influence, and be affected by
  the social environment. By using long periods of research and rehearsal, we create
  theatre that alludes to the rebuilding of a sense of **community** in contemporary
  society.   \n  \nOur first collaborator was a fish from LIDL."

  bio: |-
    She is a theatre maker, actress and performer. She lives and works in Berlin and Vienna. In her work she is interested in using a strong visual language with non-linear forms of narration. An interdisciplinary approach combines movement, drama, video and stage design as complementary, interconnected disciplines. A collaborative way in devising, the idea of the Poetic Body and the practice of Embodied Movement are at the core of her work.
