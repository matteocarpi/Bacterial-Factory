      Karl, like all of us, has spent a lot of time looking for his ideal habitat, where he could live in peace. He finally found it in a corner of the world where he can survive undisturbed... at least until today.

      Brian is at his first day of work. A white blood cell, recently graduated from the “Loving International School of Parasite Annihilation”. A faithful servant to the body and a small curious creature with a generous heart.

      He works in solitary but is supervised and directed by the all powerful brain, who manifests itself in the appearance of a telephone.
      In a world threatened by the problem of coexistence and compliance, is it still possible to be “Gut Buddies”?

      Robin, John and Trish are three connected with the house. Bound by routine, these domestic comrades are pulled through a frustrated sense of time waiting for ‘Adam’ to come home. The three are mischievous companions facing the dangers of the outside world coming in. It is a tale of the hopeful doubt of whether they exist or not.

      A box, placed in the centre, acting as a pedestal for the brightly lit cookie. It is an empty space, apart from Jonny and Robert, one following the other, and both showing “rattish” behaviour. They are arguing about their differences, and frustrated by their dependencies. They appear to be lost, moving forwards, as invisible forces disrupt their journey. It is a story of conformity, brotherhood, desperation and manipulation.

      A surreal journey of when man meets an android, a bath, and a fish. Through a simple effort to honour the natural world, his reality begins to warp as if his attempt to pay tribute backfires.
