company_bio: "We came across each other during our master’s course in Devising Theatre
  and Performance at **LISPA Berlin**, in collaboration with **Rose Bruford College
  London**. We are a group of interdisciplinary artists who collaborate without the
  reliance on particular hierarchies.   \n  \nWe create devised performances using
  a minimal aesthetic, and an artistic language that is malleable and accommodating
  to our visiting collaborators.   \n  \nWe want to provoke a theatrical experience
  that explores how the creation of work can inform, influence, and be affected by
  the social environment. By using long periods of research and rehearsal, we create
  theatre that alludes to the rebuilding of a sense of **community** in contemporary
  society.   \n  \nOur first collaborator was a fish from LIDL."

  name: Matteo Carpi
  bio: As an Italian person from Italy he loves cooking Italian food. But thinks nobody
    realises that he can’t cook anything else but Italian food. In his spare time,
    he makes cheese porn, which is particularly tasteless, making him a respectable
    member of the community.

  name: Ainhoa Hevia Uria
  bio: She is famous amongst friends for having an equally as large mouth as Niall.
    She is the only Spanish person to have a fake Spanish accent. She says she’s always
    cold, but we actually think she just loves the feeling of being hugged, all the
    time, by clothes.

  name: Niall Machin
  bio: If you have a question, just ask Niall. He probably wont know the answer, but
    he will tell you anyway. He easily looses his patience when people try to boycott
    his partying plans proposing karaoke nights.
